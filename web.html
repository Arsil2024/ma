 each other. They see a bear approaching them. One friend scurries up a tree, leaving the other one behind. The other friend decided to pretend to be dead.

n the tale, a parched crow discovers a pitcher with water at the bottom that is out of its grasp. The bird attempts to knock it over but is unsuccessful, so it begins to add pebbles one at a time until the water reaches the top of the pitcher and can take a sip. The story teaches us the value of hardwork and the necessity of  being smart witted in order to accomplish every task in life.There was a poor boy who would sell newspapers to pay for school. One day, he was ravenous and decided to ask for food at the next house he visited. Several people denied him food. However, a girl at one house offered him a glass of milk. She refused to take payment for it. After many years, this girl fell sick. No doctor wanted to help her. She decided to go to the best doctor in the town. The doctor spent months treating her, though she could not afford the service. When she received the hospital bill, it read ‘Paid in full, with a glass of milk.’
